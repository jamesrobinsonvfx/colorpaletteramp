# Color Palette Ramp
A Houdini HDA that creates a ramp based on a color palette from an image using
k-means clustering.

## [Get the HDA](https://github.com/jamesrobinsonvfx/colorpaletteramp/raw/0.2.0/source/otls/bin/jamesr_colorpaletteramp.hda)

Since the OTL is pretty straightforward, all the Python code lives in the
``Scripts`` section on the HDA itself. It's also included here in the
``Python2.7libs`` directory.

The VEX code is also included, but lives on the wrangles themselves also.

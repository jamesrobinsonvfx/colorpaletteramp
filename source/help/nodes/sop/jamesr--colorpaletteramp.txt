== Overview ==

Extract a color palette from an image and create a Ramp.

This node uses a VEX implementation of the simple, popular clustering algorithm
__K-Means__ to generate a color palette based on an input image. The image is
lightly pre-processed in __COPs__, then a color palette is generated in __SOPs__.

There is an alternate method that uses the Houdini Cluster SOP to cluster the
colors after moving the points into Lab space. This method is much faster when
dealing with denser images.

No input geometry is required for this node. If you want to extract a color
palette and reference it in a shader, COP, etc. you can create the ramp on its
own and channel reference from anywhere within Houdini.

NOTE:
    It could probably by much faster. Still a work in progress!

:disclosure: Technical Info
    More info about __K-Means__ [here|Wp:K-means_clustering] and
    [here|https://www.curiousily.com/posts/color-palette-extraction-with-k-means-clustering/]

    Calculations are done in CIELAB space, as it does a good job at separating
    visually-distinct colors. More about Lab [here|Wp:CIELAB_color_space#Advantages].

    The color differencing is done using ([Delta E 76|http://zschuessler.github.io/DeltaE/learn/]).
    Ideally, a future release will use Delta E 2000 for more accuracy.

    The source image is converted to Linear sRGB for a good conversion to the
    Lab colorspace.

@inputs

Geometry to Color (Optional):
    SOP geometry to apply the new color ramp to.

    When an input is connected, the output will automatically be set to pass the
    input geometry through the ramp.

@outputs

Ramped Geometry:
    [Include:#output/]

@parameters
=== Output ===
Output:
    #id: output
    Output geometry.

    When *Output* is set to *Geometry*, the ramp will be applied to the input
    geometry.

    *Palette Blocks* and *Source Image* will output the COP mesh of the Source
    Image, as well as packed boxes colored with the color palette. This can be
    useful for checking the resulting color pallete.

=== Input ===
When an input is connected, this folder will enable itself.

Group:
    #id: bindgroup
    The geometry group to apply the color to.

Group Type:
    #id: bindgrouptype
    What the group is made of.

Run Over:
    #id: bindclass
    Where to add the attribute to the geometry.

Attribute:
    #id: attribute
    The attribute to be remapped into color.

Attribute Type:
    #id: attribtype
    Where the attribute is located on the geometry.

=== Image ===
Image:
    #id: imagefile
    Name of the file to sample.

Stops:
    #id: stops
    Number of palette colors to generate.

Sort By:
    #id: sortby
    When set to something other than __None__, the color array will be sorted
    by the selected component. Options include __Hue__, __Saturation__, and
    __Value__.

Export Color Palette Detail Array Attribute:
    #id: export_colors_array
    Add the Detail Vector Array attribute __colors__ to output geometry.

Convert Colors to ACEScg Colorspace:
    #id: do_acesCG
    When working in an ACES color pipeline, it is necssary to convert 8-bit
    albedo images to the acesCG colorspace before rendering in order to avoid
    blown out colors. Enable this to convert the colors after computing the
    color palette.

    TIP:
        __Color Palette Ramp__ attempts to enable this automatically when the
        node is created based on OCIO settings. (Houdini 18.0.460+)
        See [Hom:hou.Color#ocio_activeDisplays]

    NOTE:
        If you are using a Houdini build < 18.0.460, and you are using an ACES
        workflow, be sure to untick "Linearize Non-Linear Images" and tick on
        "Convert Image to ACEScg Colorspace".

Linearize Colors:
    #id: linearize
    Linearizes the result. This is useful for rendering if you are not using an
    ACES workflow.


==== Color Clustering ====
Method:
    #id: method
    VEX K-Means:
        Vex implementation of the K-means algorithm.

    Houdini Cluster SOP:
        Use the Houdini [Node:sop/cluster] SOP to cluster the points. Moves the
        color points into world space by their Lab color position, and clusters
        there.

        This method can be orders of magnitude faster when dealing with very
        high resolution images that cannot be downsampled.

    NOTE:
        The first iteration of this tool used only the VEX implementation. The
        Houdini Cluster SOP is much more straightforward, and may be made the
        default method in a future version.

Reformat Source:
    #id: reformat_source
    Set the max axis for the image to be sampled. Keep this value as low as
    possible while still maintaining a desired result for optimization.
    Images can typically be drastically reduced and still produce a good result.

    For images that can't be downsampled very much, use the __Houdini Cluster
    SOP__ [method|#method] for better speeds.

Delta E Cutoff:
    #id: cutoff
    The accuracy of the clustering algorithm. The lower this value is, the more
    accurate the resulting palette will be. __1__ is typically a good balance
    between accuracy and speed.

    Cutoff is measured as the Euclidean distance between a color cluster's
    current position value in CIELAB space, and its position value on the
    previous iteration ([Delta E 76|http://zschuessler.github.io/DeltaE/learn/]).
    When this distance is below the cutoff, the value is considered accurate
    enough to exit the loop.

    TIP:
        See [this page|http://zschuessler.github.io/DeltaE/learn/] for a chart
        about Delta E

Max Iterations:
    #id: max_iterations
    The maximum number of times to run the clustering loop. Ideally, the cutoff
    value is achieved before reaching this number. This helps prevent the loop
    from possibly running forever.

    With a really low cutoff value, you may need to increase the number of
    iterations that the clustering algorithm is allowed to execute in order to
    achieve the desired threshold.

K-Means Cluster Seed:
    #id: seed
    Random seed to start the clustering from.

Output Final Iteration Number Attribute:
    #id: export_num_iter
    Add the Detail attribute __num_iter__ to the output geometry. __num_iter__
    can be used to see how many times the algorithm needed to loop in order to
    break the [cutoff|#cutoff] threshold.

=== Pre-Process Source Image ===
If the source image includes a lot of darks/lights that aren't interesting for
you palette, you can so a simple luma key on the source so that those values
aren't considered for color clustering.

Luminance Min:
    #id: luminance_min
    Values below this number will not be considered for the palette.

Luminance Max:
    #id: luminance_max
    Values above this will not be considered for the palette.

=== Result ===

Ramp:
    #id: ramp
    Ramp result of the color palette.

    This ramp will be applied to the input geometry if supplied. You can channel
    reference it wherever you please.

    TIP:
        You can ((Shift + LMB)) on ramp stops to select multiple. This is really
        useful for changing all of the stops' interpolation at once.
